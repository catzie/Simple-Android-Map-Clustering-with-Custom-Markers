# Simple-Android-Map-Clustering-with-Custom-Markers

Simple Google Maps on Android app with custom markers for clustering. For a version with default map markers, please check [catzie/SimpleAndroidMapClustering](https://github.com/catzie/SimpleAndroidMapClustering)

I simply took necessary files from Android Maps Utility Demo to create a basic app with a map with clustering feature, hoping it would be useful for developers who need only this feature from the Android Maps Utility Demo.

Feel free to use this as a basis of your new projects.

## Before running this app
Edit app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml and place your Android API key. My dev notes in the link below has a guide on how one could get such API key.
